## Linear: Ticketing & Project Management

We track our tickets and projects in Linear (https://linear.app), a project management tool. Use the Linear MCP for communicating with Linear.

The ticket numbers follow the format "ZCO-<number>". Always reference tickets by their number.

If you create a ticket, and it's not clear which project to assign it to, prompt the user. When creating subtasks, use the project of the parent ticket by default.
